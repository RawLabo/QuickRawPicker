## Why QuickRawPicker?
* **To save time.** QuickRawPicker is very fast for checking multiple raw photos at the same time. It is speed oriented and built with C++ and Godot game engine. With the 16-bit texture feature, it is easy to check if the raw photo is overexposed or too noisy in dark areas.
* **To save money.** You can easily use QuickRawPicker as a pre-step to Rawtherapee or Darktable for that QuickRawPicker has XMP and PP3 ratings and is compatible with most free raw editing softwares on the market.
* **Cross platforms.** Most major desktop platforms are natively supported. **(Windows x64 | Linux x64 | macOS Intel / Apple silicon)**
* **Small size and ease of use.** The zip package is only about 30MB, no installation and no complicated setup.

## Workflows
1. **By rating**. By Rating your raw photos in QuickRawPicker, the rating score will be written into the sidecar file `xmp` or `pp3`. And then you can filter and edit them in Adobe Bridge, Lightroom, Darktable or Rawtherapee directly. [demo](https://github.com/qdwang/QuickRawPicker/discussions/4)
2. **By marking and exporting**. By marking your raw photos in QuickRawPicker, you can later export all the marked photo files to a desired folder. Usually this method can used to check the raw files on the SD card directly and export the marked ones to your hard drive on computer. [demo](https://github.com/qdwang/QuickRawPicker/discussions/2)
